# Getting Started with Running Pollen Patrol

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Setting up Firebase

Head to the firebase website to sign up and create a new free project. After you have created a new project we need to setup the actual database. First setup a realtime database in production mode. There is no changes or rules to be changed here. Create a firestore database in production mode and then setup two collection fields. 

Start a collection called logs and auto-assign an ID. Create two fields called action and user. 
Start a second collection called users with fields location and name.

One last rule change needs to be made to allow entries in the database. Go to the rules page under the firestore database and change line 5 from `allow read, write: if false;` to `allow read, write: if true;`

## Setting API keys for Ambee and Firebase

All we need to do to setup API keys is to create a folder in root called env and add your Ambee and firebase API keys to this file. Declare your AMBEE API key after creating an account like `REACT_APP_AMBEE_API_KEY`. Then go to your firestore database and get your API key under project settings. Paste only the `const firebaseconfig` part, as seen below, from your database into the same env folder and you're good to go.
